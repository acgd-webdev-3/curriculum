      ## Thinking in text

      *How should interfaces be described with only text, like a computer or a screen reader interperets?*

      - What should be described?
      - What order should the information be described?
      - Are there elements that have functionality?
      - Are there repeated patterns?

      ## Set up

      1. Form into pairs
      2. Get out a pencil and a piece of paper
      3. We’ll do each ativivity one-by-one and discuss the results
        <br>*Volunteers can even read their solutions out in robot voices!*

      **Don’t look ahead the answers are within!**
